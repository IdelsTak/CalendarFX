RELEASE NOTES, VERSION 11.12.x (October 2022)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** NEW FEATURES

ResourcesView
-------------

A new view called "ResourcesView" was added. It can be used to add allocations
to one or more resources / people. A typical use case would be a personal that
is working at a barber / hairdresser. The calendar entries would represent
customer appointments. This view can either display "dates over resources" or
"resources over dates". As part of the development of we added the "Resource"
model class. This class stores a regular calendar and a special one called the
"availability calendar". The availability of a resource can be edited when the
view's "editAvailability" property is set to true.

BackgroundCanvas
----------------

To visualize the availability of a Resource we decided to use a canvas instead
of scene graph nodes. The performance is just much better and availability is
usually expressed by greying out the background of a resource. For controlling
the availability granularity and color please see DateControl#availabilityGrid
and DateControl#availabilityColor.

The background canvas also renders new light-weight grid lines. This is needed
as the availability grid could lead to the creation of many more grid lines
compared to the previous full- and half-hour grid lines. However, these light-
weight grid lines can not be styled via CSS. See the DateControl#gridLineColor
property.

DayEntryView
------------

It is now possible to set a "click count" number for showing the details of an
entry view. In the past the user always had to double click on the entry. Now
a single or a tripple click can also be configured.

*** ENHANCEMENTS

DayViewEditController
---------------------

With the addition of the availability feature we had to revisit the logic for
editing day entry views. The code became too messy and had to be refactored.
When comparing the before and after of this class one will notice that the new
code is much more structured.

Calendar
--------

A new "user object" property was added to the calendar so that a link can be
created between the calendar and its data source or its business object.

*** FIXES

Recurrence entries were not updated correctly in certain circumstances. This
has been fixed.
